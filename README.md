Multimodal Convolutional Neural Network for drug drug associated events predictions.
Used Drug bank dataset.
And achived an accuracy of 90.00
The feature of drugs are used smiles (Chemical substructure), target,
Enzyme, and pathways.
The events.db file contain data of the paper which is a sqlite file.
For extraction of data use spider file.
